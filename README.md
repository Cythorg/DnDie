# DnDie
A basic python tkinter application

Allows you to roll the default set of dice that are often used in Dungeons and Dragons,
designed to be a near-copy of the official Wizards of the Coast online dice roller
(https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm).

However this one can be used offline! (ooooo!)
